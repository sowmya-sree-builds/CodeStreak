## 🚀 Code Streak: Daily Coding Challenges  

Welcome to **Code Streak!** 🎯 This repository is my commitment to **solving a coding challenge every day** to improve problem-solving skills and maintain coding discipline.

## 📌 Repository Structure  

Each day, I solve one coding problem and store it in a separate folder. The **problem statement** is written as comments inside the solution file.

## 🏆 Challenge Goals  

✅ Solve **one coding problem daily**  
✅ Write **clean, well-documented code**  
✅ Master **the Depths of Programming** (Python)  
✅ Improve **problem-solving & algorithmic thinking**

## 📂 Daily Challenge Format  

Each challenge file follows this structure:  

```python
# Problem: Find the maximum number in an array
# Given an array of numbers, return the largest number in the list.

def find_max(arr):
    return max(arr)

# Example Usage:
numbers = [3, 8, 1, 5, 12]
print(find_max(numbers))  # Output: 12
```
